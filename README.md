# AdventureBot
A Mastodon adventure game bot project using TootNet and LiteDB witten in C# .NET as a console app. 

Hobby, unfinished, broken mostly.

I'm hobby-writing a bot that will interact with its followers on Mastodon (https://mastodon.social/about).

I'm using botsin.space with this profile (https://botsin.space/@adventurebot)

This is likely to be very basic and quite broken for some time. I'll update this when it's worth downloading to look at.
